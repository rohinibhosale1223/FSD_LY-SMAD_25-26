              <p class="card-text text-center">
                A tribute to Pagani's first customer, Benny Caiola, the Huayra
                BC is an even more extreme iteration of the already formidable
                Huayra. Its AMG-sourced twin-turbocharged V12 engine is
                meticulously crafted to deliver breathtaking power. The car's
                construction is a masterclass in lightweight engineering,
                featuring advanced carbon-titanium materials. Active
                aerodynamics, with striking movable flaps, ensures phenomenal
                downforce and stability. The interior is a bespoke work of art,
                blending exposed mechanical elements with the finest leathers
                and carbon fiber.

              <h5 class="card-title text-center">Bugatti Divo</h5>
              <p class="card-text text-center">
                Crafted for corners, the Bugatti Divo is a coach-built hypercar
                based on the Chiron, with a focus on aerodynamic efficiency and
                handling. Its aggressive design, featuring a larger fixed rear
                wing and numerous air inlets, generates significantly more
                downforce. While it shares the Chiron's monstrous 8.0-liter
                quad-turbo W16 engine, the Divo's chassis and suspension are
                tuned for agility on winding roads. Production was strictly
                limited to just 40 units, making it an exceptionally rare and
                coveted machine. The Divo is a testament to Bugatti's ability to
                create a car that is as thrilling in the bends as it is in a
                straight line.

              <p class="card-text text-center">
                The Koenigsegg Jesko, a Swedish marvel of engineering, is a
                hypercar designed for ultimate track performance and high speed.
                It boasts a re-engineered 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine that
                can produce up to 1600 horsepower on E85 biofuel. A
                revolutionary nine-speed multi-clutch Light Speed Transmission
                allows for instantaneous gear changes. Its advanced
                aerodynamics, including a massive, active rear wing, provide
                incredible downforce for superior cornering. The Jesko is a
                showcase of Koenigsegg's relentless pursuit of innovation and
                record-breaking speed.

                The BMW M5 CS stands as the most powerful and track-focused M5
                ever produced by the German automaker. Its 4.4-liter M TwinPower
                Turbo V8 engine has been tuned to deliver an exhilarating 627
                horsepower. Extensive use of carbon fiber in the hood, roof, and
                other components significantly reduces weight, enhancing
                agility. The M xDrive all-wheel-drive system can be configured
                for pure rear-wheel-drive hoonery. With its exclusive
                gold-bronze accents and four individual bucket seats, the M5 CS
                is a luxurious yet ferociously capable super sedan.

                Nicknamed "The Beast of the Green Hell," the Mercedes-AMG GT R
                was honed on the demanding Nürburgring Nordschleife. Its
                handcrafted 4.0-liter biturbo V8 engine produces a thunderous
                soundtrack and immense power. An advanced nine-mode traction
                control system, derived from motorsport, allows drivers to
                fine-tune the car's handling characteristics. The GT R's
                aggressive aerodynamics, including a large rear wing and active
                front grille shutters, provide exceptional grip. This car
                represents the pinnacle of AMG's performance-oriented
                engineering for the road and track.
